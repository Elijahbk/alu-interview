Rainwater Retention Task

Description

This task involves calculating the total amount of rainwater that can be retained between walls, represented as non-negative integers in a list. Each integer in the list represents the height of a wall with a unit width of 1. The rainwater is "trapped" between the walls, and the goal is to determine how many square units of water would be retained after it rains.
